# UNKNOWN - new headline app
This project is inherited from the **newsHeadlinesApp_v1_4** in the project of [UNKNOWN](https://github.com/fitosegrera/unknown#newsHeadlinesAPP).

But here are some compliments.

## How to build the project
1. Download openFrameworks v0.11.2 [HERE](https://objects.githubusercontent.com/github-production-release-asset-2e65be/345337/aba2f5a5-07bc-4891-bb3f-f6a7bb6a7378?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIWNJYAX4CSVEH53A%2F20230426%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230426T072718Z&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Signature=148), and extract it anywhere as you like.
2. Install and test openFrameworks referring to the [DOCUMENT](https://openframeworks.cc/setup/linux-install/).
3. Enter directory of `of_v0.11.2_linux64gcc6_release/apps/myApps/` and git clone this project.
4. Rename the directory name of the project to `newsHeadlinesApp_v1_4`, which will determine the executable file's name generated by Makefile.
5. In the terminal, execute `make Release; bin/unknown-news-app` to run the news headline app. Or you can run an IDE which supports Makefile. Clion and VS code are recommended.

## Modifications
1. Remove intermediate products from the git repo, which is the directory of `obj/`
2. Remove binary products from the git repo, which is `bin/newsHeadlinesApp` file.
3. Remove addon `ofxTrueTypeFontUC` from `addons.make` file, and add the source code of it to the project.
